# RizzyUI Accessibility Audit (Prompt 0.1)

## Scope and method

This audit covers root-level interactive components in `src/RizzyUI` and
related runtime, docs, and tests.

Classifications:

- **ready**
- **needs minor fixes**
- **needs runtime support**
- **needs full implementation**

Recommended primitives: `focusScope`, `dismissableLayer`,
`rovingFocusGroup`, `activeDescendant`, `typeahead`, `liveAnnouncer`.

## Cross-cutting findings

- No Playwright/E2E suite was found; coverage is bUnit-centric.
- Many interactive components depend on Alpine runtime and expose limited
  declarative ARIA semantics at root markup level.
- Modal and composite widget behavior is often runtime-managed.

- Files: `src/RizzyUI/Components/Feedback/RzDialog/RzDialog.razor`,
  `src/RizzyUI/Components/Internal/RzModalPrimitive.razor`,
  `packages/rizzyui/src/js/lib/components/rzModal.js`
- Semantics: dialog role/state not explicit at root.

## Classification summary

- ready: 2
- needs minor fixes: 3
- needs runtime support: 10
- needs full implementation: 3

Total audited components: 18.

## Suggested primitive rollout order

3. `activeDescendant` + `liveAnnouncer`

## Missing or unexpected layout notes

- No dedicated SkipToContent component found.
- No Playwright/E2E test files found.
